Hi, My name is Maksim Volnov.

I'm young enterprise Java Developer and beginer game developer

Somehow you found my Git reposetory, where I store my projects.

But most of them uses lots of personal data.
So if you happen to be here to see some of my more advanced projects, please contact me and I'll provide you access.

After signing a couple of very important and serious pieces of paper, of course. We are not a black market for data!
